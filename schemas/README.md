# CNTX Schema Resources

## Status and authority

This directory contains machine-evaluable schema-resource candidates and, after exact-revision human acceptance and governed integration, accepted schema resources. A file's existence, JSON Schema validity, `$id`, Schema Version, test result, repository location, or publication does not grant Document Status, contract conformance, authority, trust, approval, release, deployment, merge permission, or access permission.

The only current resource is the **Proposed** ARCH-009 [Common Artifact Envelope `1.0.0` candidate](common-artifact-envelope/1.0.0/schema.json). Candidate drafting does not activate Accepted Schema Version `1.0.0`. The applicable architecture document and ADR remain the status sources.

## Common Artifact Envelope candidate

| Dimension | Proposed value |
| --- | --- |
| Logical schema identity | CNTX Public Core Schema Family / Common Artifact Envelope |
| Schema language and dialect | JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 |
| Dialect declaration | `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema` |
| Canonical `$id` | `https://github.com/CNTX-PROJECT/CNTX/schemas/common-artifact-envelope/1.0.0` |
| Proposed Schema Version | `1.0.0` |
| Canonical repository path | `schemas/common-artifact-envelope/1.0.0/schema.json` |
| Schema-resource media type | `application/schema+json` |
| Document Status | Proposed under issue #42 |

The `$id` is the canonical identity of the Schema Resource, not a branch, mutable retrieval coordinate, automatic network instruction, hosted-publication claim, release, tag, artifact Serialization Binding, or authority source. Processors are expected to receive the exact resource explicitly; an HTTPS-shaped identifier does not authorize network access.

## Evaluation boundary

The schema evaluates one Common Artifact Envelope object. It does not define a complete artifact container, normative `envelope` placement, artifact-specific payload or relationship semantics, Extension Module, Profile, validator, resolver, bundler, serialization, transport, storage, runtime, provider, product, or private implementation.

All reusable subschemas are internal members of the root `$defs`. They have no nested `$id`, independent Schema Version, Document Status, or public compatibility guarantee. External schemas must reference the accepted root resource, not a root `$defs` JSON Pointer.

The non-normative [test-case manifest](../tests/schemas/common-artifact-envelope/1.0.0/cases.json) supplies synthetic validation evidence only. It is not an artifact contract, Serialization Binding, validator, conformance claim, authority source, or accepted example payload.

## Change boundary

Once an exact `1.0.0` resource is accepted, its canonical standalone content is immutable. Any accepted structural or semantic change requires the ARCH-002 and ARCH-006 version assessment, attributable review and approval, traceable provenance, and a separately authorized change. Schema validity alone cannot approve such a change.
